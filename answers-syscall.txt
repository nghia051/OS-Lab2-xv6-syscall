Question 1: Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
Answer: usertrap

Question 2: What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent?
Answer:
- The value of p->trapframe->a7 is 7
- This value represent the system call SYS_exec (initcode.S places the arguments for exec in registers a0 and a1, and puts the system call number in a7).

Question 3: What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
Answer:
(gdb) p/t $sstatus           
$4 = 100010

As we can see, the value of the SPP bit is 0, which indicates that the privilege level before entering the kernel for the system call was user mode.
